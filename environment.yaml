# This file may be used to create an environment using:
# conda env create --file environment.yaml

# Keep pip installations to a minimum, and install
# dependencies with conda instead. To test, use:
# pip install oemof --dry-run

# Common errors:

# "Cannot mix incompatible Qt library (5.15.8) with this library (5.15.6)"

# Qt is a library for graphical user interfaces.
# This error can occur when you have separate conda environments with
# different versions of the package "PyQt5". It should be solved by
# making sure your new environments use the same version as your base
# environment.
# In the example above, we can run the command
# "conda list qt"
# to find the actual package name that causes the issue and then
# "conda install qt-main==5.15.6"
